## About me 🧑‍💻

<img align="right" src="assets/gifs/bac_programing.gif" width="220"/>
👋 Hi! My name is **Deisiane** (call me "Deisi"), and since I was young I’ve always been fascinated by science, discovery and how things work. Along my journey, curiosity became one of my strongest skills — and it’s exactly what brought me into research and technology. I have experience in microbiology, Bioinformatics and scientific research, and I’m currently transitioning to new challenges, always motivated by learning and growth. I love projects that involve innovation, creativity, communities (microbial or human 😄) and exploring new possibilities. My long-term goal is to make evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses more accessible and intuitive for a broad audience
