## 🧑‍💻 About Me

# HELLO EVERYONE! 💗

👋 Hi! My name is **Deisiane** (call me "Deisi"), and since I was young I’ve always been fascinated by science, discovery and how things work.  
Along my journey, curiosity became one of my strongest skills — and it’s exactly what brought me into research and technology.

🧬 I have experience in microbiology, scientific research, and I’m currently transitioning to new challenges, always motivated by learning and growth.

💡 I love projects that involve innovation, creativity, communities (microbial or human 😄) and exploring new possibilities.  
My dream is to contribute with meaningful work that makes people’s lives better.
